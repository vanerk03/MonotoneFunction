# MonotoneFunction

DFS-based algorithm to check whether boolean function is monotone or not

Time complexity of the algorithm is <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=O%28n%20%5Ccdot%20%282%5En%29%29%0A%0A&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0" align="center" border="0" alt="O(n \cdot (2^n))" width="87" height="19" /> where __n__ is arity. There is no proven algorithm that performs better in terms of time complexity.
